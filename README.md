# animatedTensorFlowFit
Performs an animated fit of random function using fully connected network in tensor flow


The below code performs an animated fit of a random function using a pyTorch fully connected network. 
```
python animatedRegressor.py
```
For relatively complex function like *sin(x^2)* the network performs well for a higher number of steps.
